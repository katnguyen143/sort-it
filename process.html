I had at least 5 different project ideas until I finally decided what I wanted to&nbsp;do. As&nbsp;a member of my school's environmental club,
                                    Carlmont Green Team, we established a tri-bin system that wasn't quite working out the way we wanted it to. Student volunteers were taking out the trash because there wasn't enough funding to hand the job over to the
                                    janitors, so it wasn't the most sustainable project in the long run. Additionally, not all of the students knew how to sort their waste, so the bins were just getting contaminated.&nbsp;We decided that things needed
                                    to change, so we ordered big compost bins for our school, made a video to educate the student body, and moved the tri-bins to sit at the back of the school. After this entire process, trash finally started getting sorted.​
                                    <br><br>When I saw the bins just sitting there, it seemed like such a waste (no pun intended). That's when an idea sparked, and&nbsp;I decided to bring those tri-bins to Ralston Middle School.​ <br><br>After proposing
                                    the project idea to principal Michael Dougherty, he mentioned that a tri-bin system was something many people at Ralston had wanted and agreed to work with me.</p><a class="card-link" href="#"></a><a class="card-link"

She is a Waste Zero Specialist at Recology and really helped guide me through the whole process such as helping me come up with ways to educate
                                    the students, printing flyers, logistics, and more. Without her, I would have definitely struggled with the process more than I already did!</p>

Although emailing would appear to do the trick, this was not always the case. It took a bit of time to receive responses because
                                    of the principal's busy schedule, and I hadn't known he was on paternity leave until a few emails and weeks later. At each meeting, I would show up with questions and things that needed to be done. From there, we would
                                    discuss our next steps, which would include things that each of us needed to do.&nbsp;</p>

Since the bins had been sitting outside for a couple of months, they were dirty and needed to be cleaned. When
                                    I announced this volunteer opportunity to the club, I was afraid not many people would show up because cleaning trash bins was unappealing to many. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the turnout! We got the job
                                    done within a couple of hours, and the bins were brought to Ralston by Carlmont's custodians later that week.<br><br><img class="justify-content-center" src="assets/img/IMG_5923.JPG" style="width: 500px;height: 434px;"></p>

                                <p class="text-left card-text" style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 30px;padding: 40px;font-family: Amiko, sans-serif;">When the tri-bins were brought to Ralston, I delivered&nbsp;some of the posters my club members and I made. Olivia Long, president of Ralston's student government, helped hang up the posters soon after the bins were brought
                                    over. Unfortunately, shortly after we began preparing to put the tri-bins out, school had to shut down due to the coronavirus.&nbsp;<br><br>Nevertheless, during quarantine, I kept in contact with Mr. Dougherty and improved
                                    the sorting guide and resources. During the first quarter, students will be educated and ready for the tri-bins when it's safe to go back to school!</p>
