At every meeting, he was always prepared to take notes and carry out the plan. I am so grateful for his assistance, ability to listen thoughtfully, and receptiveness to my new ideas!<br><br>The next person I'd like to thank is my advisor, Reyna Oceguera. She was always quick to respond to my emails, give suggestions when I was struggling,&nbsp;and help out with certain tasks, tasks, such as printing flyers and contacting the principal. It was so helpful having her expertise by my side along the way, especially for the logistics that went into ordering the compost yard bin and providing cost estimate.<br><br>Next, I would like to thank Ralston student government's president, Olivia Long for working with me during the spring. Without her, I wouldn't have known what was going on at Ralston. It's difficult trying to implement something at a school I don't go to, so it was super helpful to send emails back and forth about what's going on, what she can help me with next, what needs to be done, etc. Her team helped create and hang up posters around school and pushed my project forward.&nbsp;<br><br>I'd also like to thank my troop leader, Terri for her continuous support throughout my project! She helped me get started, motivated and encouraged me each month, and always had helpful input whenever I requested additional assistance.<br><br>Last but not least, thanks to all the volunteers who helped me create the video, flyers, and clean the tri-bins! I am beyond grateful to have had fellow peers by my side during the difficult moments. I truly enjoyed working with everyone who contributed their time and efforts into this initiative, and I hope to leave behind a long-lasting legacy that inspires other students to create change in their communities and beyond.<br><br>I hope my story has inspired you to consider taking action in your community; while it might be a long process, the end result is definitely worth the time, challenges, and effort! While I can now proudly call myself a Gold Award Girl Scout, I know that this is just the beginning â€“ I want to create positive, long-lasting change for the rest of my life.<br></p>
