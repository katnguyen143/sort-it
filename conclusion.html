My heart is beating like crazy as I fathom the words to describe how amazing it feels to have made a positive difference in my community.&nbsp;<br><br>I'd like
                        to thank principal Michael Dougherty at Ralston Middle School for working with me on this project. We scheduled several meetings together this past year to talk about the next steps. He was always helpful when suggesting ideas,
                        listening to my plans, and going through with them. Without his help, I would have struggled for sure!<br><br>The next person I'd like to thank is my advisor, Reyna Oceguera. She was always quick to respond to my emails, give suggestions
                        when I was struggling,&nbsp;and helped me with many tasks like printing flyers and contacting the principal. It was super helpful to work with someone at Recology, since I needed a connection for the compost bin that needed to
                        be implemented. She was also able to create a cost estimate for the compost, which I would not have any idea how to do. She basically took care of all the real work.&nbsp;<br><br>Next, I would like to thank Ralston student gov's
                        president, Olivia Long for working with me during the spring. Without her, I wouldn't have known what was going on at Ralston. It's difficult trying to implement something at a school I don't go to, so it was super helpful to send
                        emails back and forth about what's going on, what she can help me with next, what needs to be done, etc. Her team helped create and hang up posters around school and pushed my project forward.&nbsp;<br><br>I'd also like to thank
                        my troop leader, Terri for her continuous support throughout my project! She helped me get started, motivated and encouraged each month, and always had helpful input whenever I asked for guidance!<br><br>Last but not least, thanks
                        to all the volunteers who helped me create the video, flyers, and clean the tri-bins! I was so grateful to have people on my side while I stressed out over every detail. When I set up the first sign-up sheet, I was so scared that
                        no one would sign up. I dreaded checking it because I was afraid that the only name on there would be mine. When I saw at least ten names on the list, I was so happy I cried! I truly enjoyed working with everyone who helped me
                        and I am extremely grateful to have such passionate people on my side who are interested in creating change in our community.<br><br>All in all, I am so grateful that all of these people around me were able to help me accomplish
                        something so big. When Ralston students enter high school, they'll have this knowledge set-up for them to sort their waste properly! Of course, the Green Team at Carlmont will still be working on educating the student body each
                        year to maintain the campus' sustainability. Incoming Ralston students will be educated on how to sort their waste during Orientation. I hope my story has inspired you to consider taking action in your community; while it might
                        be a long process, the end result is definitely worth the time, challenges, and effort! There is no Planet B, so we should all do what we can to make a positive difference in the world, no matter how small. :)<br><br>Sincerely,&nbsp;<br>Kat
